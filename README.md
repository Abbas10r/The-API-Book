## Current State and the Roadmap

Right now Section I (‘API Design’) is finished. The Section is lacking readable schemes, I'll draw them later.

Book will contain two more sections.
  * Section II ‘Backwards Compatibility’ will cover growth issues. Major themes are:
    * major sources of problems leading to backwards compatibility breach;
    * interface decomposing allowing for third-party plugins and switching underlying technologies;
    * structuring public and private parts of your API;
    * versioning policies;
    * common mistakes.
  * Section III ‘API as a Product’ will be discussing non-technical issues:
    * what for the APIs exist;
    * monetizing APIs;
    * making sure your understand users' needs and collect proper metrics;
    * common practices, including AA issues and fraud problems;
    * organizing docs portal;
    * open source and community.

I also have more distant plans on adding two more subsections to Section I.
  * Section Ia ‘JSON HTTP APIs’:
    * the REST myth;
    * following HTTP spec, including those parts where you should not follow the spec;
    * best practices;
  * Section Ib ‘SDK Design’ covering more tricky issues of having proving UI alongside the API (no specific plan right now)

## Translation

I will translate sections into English at the moment they're ready. Which means that Section I will be translated soon.
