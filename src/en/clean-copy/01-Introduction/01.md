### On the Structure of This Book

The book you're holding in your hands comprises this Introduction and three large sections.

In Section I we'll discuss designing the API as a concept: how to build the architecture properly, from a high-level planning down to final interfaces.

Section II is dedicated to API's lifecycle: how interfaces evolve over time, and how to elaborate the product to match users' needs.

Finally, Section III is more about un-engineering sides of the API, like API marketing, organizing support, and working with a community.

First two sections are the most interesting to engineers, while third section is being more relevant to both engineers and product managers. But we insist that this section is the most important for the API software developer. Since API is the product for engineers, you cannot simply pronounce non-engineering team responsible for its product planning and support. Nobody but you understands more what product features your API is capable of.

Let's start.
