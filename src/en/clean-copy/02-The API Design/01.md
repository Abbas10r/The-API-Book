### API Contexts Pyramid

The approach we use to design API comprises four steps:
  * defining an application field;
  * separating abstraction levels;
  * isolating responsibility areas;
  * describing final interfaces.

This for-step algorithm actually builds an API from top to bottom, from common requirements and use case scenarios down to refined entity nomenclature. In fact, moving this way you will eventually get a ready-to-use API â€” that's why we value this approach.

It might seem that the most useful pieces of advice are given in a last chapter, but that's not true. The cost of a mistake made at certain levels differs. Fixing naming is simple; revising wrong understanding what the API stands for is practically impossible.

**NB**. Here and throughout we will illustrate API design concepts using a hypothetical example of an API allowing for ordering a cup of coffee in city cafes. Just in case: this example is totally synthetic. If we were to design such an API in a real world, it would probably have very few in common with our fictional example.
